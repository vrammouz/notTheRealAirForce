			<h2>The stories of men and women in the air force</h2>
				<div><q>If they had told me girls can't be fighter pilots, I wouldn't be here today.</q> -Lt Col Nicole Malachowski</div>
				<p class="component">
				During the first 58 years of the Air Force Thunderbirds, there had never been a female demonstration pilot. So when Lt Col Malachowski decided to throw her helmet into the ring, history was not exactly on her side. But after 10 years, thousands of hours in the cockpit and an intense application process, she got the call to don the emblem of America’s Ambassadors in Blue, paving the way for future female pilots.

				<div ><q>If it left the surface of the earth it was probably going to fill my imagination.</q> -Col (RET) Benjamin Alvin Drew, Jr.</div>
				<p class="component">
				Like every other kid, Col Alvin Drew dreamed of becoming an astronaut. So after graduating from the Air Force Academy and assignments as a helicopter pilot and then a test pilot, he was selected by NASA to be a Mission Specialist. In 2007, his childhood dream came true when he flew on the Space Shuttle Endeavor and then returned to space in 2011 on the final mission of Space Shuttle Discovery.
